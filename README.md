#### About

This software has been released as a part of an SERB project on precise and scalable program analysis. The project started late, funding was delayed 
signigicantly so this is not a complete work and is a snapshot of the work when the sponsored project ended. Subsequently work is being carried out 
separately.

#### LFCPA using VASCO

This is an implementation of Liveness-based Flow- and Context-Sensitive Points-to Analysis using VASCO framework for context-sensitivity.
